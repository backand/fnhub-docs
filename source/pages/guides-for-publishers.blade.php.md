## For Function publishers

Publishing a function on FnHub.io is quick and easy! Just follow these three steps to release your package to the world:

1. Initialize your function package using fnhub init:

    `fnhub init --name myAwesomePackage --author test@example.com`

2. Add your serverless functions to the module using fnhub add:

    `fnhub add -fn functionName -fnh index.handler -fnr nodejs6.10`

3. Publish your module to fnhub.io using fnhub publish:

    `fnhub publish`

And that's it! With these three commands completed, your function is now available on FnHub.io, ready to be distributed to the serverless development community!
